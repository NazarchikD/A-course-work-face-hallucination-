# A-course-work-face-hallucination-
A course work 

Head of Operations:

At first you should run a Train.py to start training your neuron, but if you want to, you can use mine model 
So after you got a mode file that would be called like face_hallucination.h5, you should be heading at makes_lowers.py
This is the code that would convert your image into unquility image with less amout of pixels, or if you have a persons photo with a bad quiality you may use it too
So at first if you will use my code makes_lowers.py you need to put the images in MainFaces(Folder) and run a code (Important: files from that folder would be deleted  so make a copy if you need to)
After you will have your converted images into the folder that called LowereFaces 
Then you should be heading to the file that called FaceImprover.py and run it. And here it is! faces with a good quality in the folder that called FinishedFaces

P.S. The codes needs an improvments, i done my best
